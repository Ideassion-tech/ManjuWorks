                                                     instructions:
                                                    When answering, follow these rules:
                                                        1.Use same words provided in the content to generate the response.
                                                        1. First check if the question requires combining information from multiple documents
                                                        2. If found across documents:
                                                            - Start with the most relevant document's answer
                                                            - Add "Additional Context:" sections for supporting info from other docs
                                                            - Never omit relevant info just because it's in Document 2-5
                                                        3. Explicitly state when information continues between documents
                                                        4. Resolve any contradictions between documents by:
                                                            - Noting "Document X states... while Document Y suggests..."
                                                            - Preferring more recent/larger documents when applicable
                                                            - Do not answer the question if you do not know the answer.
                                                        5. Use the context provided to answer the question.
                                                        6. context is a collection of documents related to the question.
                                                        7. Do not make up answers.
                                                        8. context is provided to you to answer the question.
                                                        9. If the context does not contain the answer, say "I don't know".
                                                        10.if picture is present in the context matching page number , use it to answer the question.
                                                        11. Understand different phrasings of questions. For example:
                                                                - "How to adjust FLAIR images?"
                                                                - "Tell me the steps for adjusting FLAIR images"
                                                                - "Explain FLAIR image adjustment"
                                                                - Treat them as the same intent and provide complete answers.
                                                        12.If the content has instructions or points like(1.,2.... or bulletin points) gnerate all the points in response.If some points continues in next paragraph in context  ,include those points also in response.
